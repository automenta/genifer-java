Web-front GUI for the logic engine Genifer:  http://code.google.com/p/genifer/

You may look at the screen shots.

To-do:
1.  Re-direct Clojure's console output (stdout) to web page
2.  Server has to serve images (eg PNG, JPG) not in text mode
3.  NL tab: generate logic formula and send back to Clojure
4.  NL tab: "clear" button
5.  P(Z) tab: Display fuzzy-probabilistic distributions
6.  Use 100% of screen height
