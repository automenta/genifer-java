Web-front GUI for the logic engine Genifer:  http://code.google.com/p/genifer/

You may look at the cheat sheet and screen shots.

To-do:
*  Re-direct Clojure's console output (stdout) to web page
*  NL tab: replace numbers in formula with corresponding words
*  P(Z) tab: Display fuzzy-probabilistic distributions
*  NL tab: draw arrow heads instead of dots (may need low-level javascript)
*  Use 100% of screen height
*  Server has to serve images (eg PNG, JPG) not in text mode
