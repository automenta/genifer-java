// * Sentence formation
// -- words draggable? OK!
// -- words deletable? OK!
//
// * Keyboard
// -- can type letters to form words?
// -- words can then be inserted at certain positions? OK!

// * Suggestions based on existing words
// -- based on what words are in target sentence
// -- which words follow or are associated with existing words

// * Fixed phrases (are also suggestions)
// -- tree-style menu, for contexts -- OK!
// -- such contexts may be displayed automatically or selected manually
// -- each phrases is added as a whole, but tokenized upon dropping

// * Send to Adult Chatroom
// -- send message -- OK!
// -- remove ()'s -- OK!

// The problem is: suggestions are in a bag, but fixed phrases are in context menu,
// how to unify them?  Perhaps contexts are tags-like, but chosen from a tree-menu?
// Or perhaps word-suggestions and fixed phrases are separate?

// What is the best way to suggest words?
// -- based on existing words in a partial sentence typed so far
//		-- then suggest words that are "associated"
// -- let user select a "topic" or "context" or several "tags"
